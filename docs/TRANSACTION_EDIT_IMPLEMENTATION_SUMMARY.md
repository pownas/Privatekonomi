## Ready for Implementation

The specification is complete and ready for development team implementation:

### Available Resources
- ✅ Complete functional specification (`TRANSACTION_EDIT_SPEC.md`)
- ✅ Visual wireframes for desktop and mobile
- ✅ Ready-to-use GitHub issues and development tasks
- ✅ Technical architecture and API designs
- ✅ Test scenarios and acceptance criteria
- ✅ Implementation timeline and resource planning

### Next Steps
1. **Stakeholder Review**: Schedule review meeting with PO, UX, and Backend lead
2. **Issue Creation**: Use templates in `IMPLEMENTATION_ISSUES.md` to create GitHub issues
3. **Sprint Planning**: Allocate stories to development sprints based on roadmap
4. **Development Start**: Begin with Phase 1 backend foundation work

## Decision Points for Stakeholder Review

The following decisions need stakeholder input before implementation:

1. **Household Transaction Policy**: How should edits to shared household transactions be handled?
2. **Inline Category Creation**: Should users be able to create new categories during editing?
3. **Export Volume Limits**: What's the acceptable threshold for synchronous vs asynchronous exports?
4. **Lock Policy**: When should transactions be locked and who can unlock them?
5. **Audit Retention**: How long should detailed change history be retained?

## Success Metrics

- **User Experience**: >95% task completion rate for transaction editing
- **Performance**: <300ms API response time for transaction updates
- **Audit Compliance**: 100% of changes properly logged and traceable
- **Export Capability**: Support for >100k transaction exports
- **Error Rate**: <1% conflicts in concurrent editing scenarios
- **Accessibility**: WCAG 2.1 AA compliance for all new components
