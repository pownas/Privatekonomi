# Implementation Summary: Automatic Categorization and Intelligence

## Overview

This implementation addresses the issue "Automatisering och intelligens" by creating a comprehensive rule-based automatic categorization system for transactions.

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Core Models and Services

#### CategoryRule Model
- Pattern-based matching system with support for:
  - **Exact**: Pattern must match exactly
  - **Contains**: Pattern can appear anywhere
  - **StartsWith**: Text must start with pattern
  - **EndsWith**: Text must end with pattern
  - **Regex**: Full regular expression support
- Priority system for rule evaluation
- Field matching options (Description, Payee, or Both)
- Active/inactive status for easy management

#### CategoryRuleService
- Full CRUD operations for categorization rules
- Pattern matching engine with regex support
- Rule application for single or bulk transactions
- Priority-based rule evaluation

#### Enhanced TransactionService
- Integrated automatic categorization on transaction creation
- Two-tier approach:
  1. Rule-based categorization (primary)
  2. Similarity-based categorization (fallback)

### 2. Pre-configured Rules (44 total)

Rules cover Swedish merchants and services across 8 categories:

- **Mat & Dryck (10 rules)**: ICA, Coop, Willys, Hemköp, Restaurants, Cafes, Fast food
- **Transport (7 rules)**: SL-kort, Gas stations (Circle K, Preem), Parking, Taxi, SJ
- **Boende (5 rules)**: Rent, Electricity (Vattenfall), Broadband (Telia), Insurance
- **Nöje (6 rules)**: Spotify, Netflix, Cinema (SF Bio), Gym, Theatre, Concerts
- **Shopping (6 rules)**: H&M, IKEA, Elgiganten, Clas Ohlson, Stadium, Pharmacy
- **Hälsa (4 rules)**: Dental care, Pharmacy, Naprapathy, Vitamins
- **Lön (3 rules)**: Salary, Bonus, Vacation pay
- **Sparande (2 rules)**: Savings, ISK (Investment savings account)

### 3. User Interface

#### CategoryRules Page (/category-rules)
- Comprehensive table view of all rules
- Display of pattern, match type, category, priority, and status
- Create new rules with form validation
- Edit existing rules
- Delete rules with confirmation
- Visual category indicators with color-coded chips
- Responsive design for mobile and desktop

#### Navigation
- Added "Kategoriseringsregler" menu item with AutoAwesome icon
- Easy access from main navigation menu

### 4. API Endpoints

Complete REST API for rule management:

```
GET    /api/categoryrules          - Get all rules
GET    /api/categoryrules/active   - Get active rules only
GET    /api/categoryrules/{id}     - Get specific rule
POST   /api/categoryrules          - Create new rule
PUT    /api/categoryrules/{id}     - Update rule
DELETE /api/categoryrules/{id}     - Delete rule
POST   /api/categoryrules/test     - Test pattern matching
POST   /api/categoryrules/apply    - Apply rules to transactions
```

### 5. Database Integration

- Added `CategoryRules` DbSet to PrivatekonomyContext
- Configured indexes for performance (Priority, IsActive)
- Relationship to Category with cascade delete
- Seeding of 44 default rules in TestDataSeeder

### 6. Documentation

#### AUTOMATIC_CATEGORIZATION.md
Comprehensive documentation including:
- Feature overview and usage
- Pre-configured rules list
- UI guide with screenshots
- API reference with examples
- Technical implementation details
- Code examples for developers
- Future improvement suggestions

#### Updated README.md
- Enhanced feature description for automatic categorization
- Link to detailed documentation
- Listed as a key feature

## Technical Implementation Details

### Pattern Matching Engine

The `CategoryRuleService` implements a robust pattern matching engine:

```csharp
private bool MatchesPattern(CategoryRule rule, string text)
{
    var comparison = rule.CaseSensitive 
        ? StringComparison.Ordinal 
        : StringComparison.OrdinalIgnoreCase;
    
    return rule.MatchType switch
    {
        PatternMatchType.Exact => text.Equals(pattern, comparison),
        PatternMatchType.Contains => text.Contains(pattern, comparison),
        PatternMatchType.StartsWith => text.StartsWith(pattern, comparison),
        PatternMatchType.EndsWith => text.EndsWith(pattern, comparison),
        PatternMatchType.Regex => MatchesRegex(pattern, text, rule.CaseSensitive),
        _ => false
    };
}
```

### Automatic Application

Transactions are automatically categorized when created:

```csharp
public async Task<Transaction> CreateTransactionAsync(Transaction transaction)
{
    if (!transaction.TransactionCategories.Any())
    {
        // Try rule-based categorization first
        var ruleCategoryId = await _categoryRuleService.ApplyCategoryRulesAsync(
            transaction.Description, 
            transaction.Payee);
        
        if (ruleCategoryId.HasValue)
        {
            // Apply rule-based category
        }
        else
        {
            // Fall back to similarity-based categorization
        }
    }
    
    _context.Transactions.Add(transaction);
    await _context.SaveChangesAsync();
    return transaction;
}
```

## What Was NOT Implemented (Future Enhancements)

Based on the original issue requirements, the following were identified but not implemented in this PR:

### 1. ML-Based Categorization
- **Reason**: Requires training data and ML.NET or external ML service
- **Suggestion**: Could be added as Phase 2 after collecting sufficient transaction data

### 2. Anomaly/Fraud Detection
- **Reason**: Requires statistical analysis and baseline establishment
- **Suggestion**: Could use rule deviations and transaction pattern analysis

### 3. Cash Flow Forecasting (3-12 months)
- **Reason**: Requires historical data analysis and prediction models
- **Suggestion**: Could use time series analysis on recurring transactions

### 4. What-If Scenarios
- **Reason**: Requires budget simulation engine
- **Suggestion**: Could extend existing budget functionality

### 5. Goal Optimization
- **Reason**: Requires optimization algorithms and goal tracking
- **Suggestion**: Could extend existing goal (sparmål) functionality

### 6. Recommendations System
- **Reason**: Requires external API integrations and comparison logic
- **Suggestion**: Could integrate with price comparison services

## Testing

### Manual Testing Performed
1. ✅ Application builds successfully
2. ✅ All 44 rules are seeded on startup
3. ✅ Category Rules page displays all rules correctly
4. ✅ Rules can be created, edited, and deleted via UI
5. ✅ Pattern matching works for all match types
6. ✅ Rules are applied automatically to new transactions

### Test Coverage
- No automated tests were added (as per instructions for minimal changes)
- Manual testing confirms all functionality works as expected
