# User Authentication and Management

## Overview

Privatekonomi now includes a comprehensive user authentication and management system built on ASP.NET Core Identity. This enables multiple users to:

- Register and create their own accounts
- Log in securely with email and password
- Have completely isolated data (transactions, budgets, goals, etc.)
- Access the system from multiple devices simultaneously
- Optionally share household data when members of the same household

## Features

### User Registration and Login

- **Registration**: Users can create accounts with email, password, first name, and last name
- **Login**: Secure authentication with email and password
- **Password Requirements**: Minimum 6 characters (configurable)
- **Remember Me**: Optional persistent login sessions
- **Logout**: Secure session termination

### Data Isolation

Each user's data is completely isolated:

- **Transactions**: Only visible to the user who created them
- **Budgets**: Each user has their own budgets
- **Goals**: Personal savings goals per user
- **Bank Sources**: Bank accounts belong to individual users
- **Investments, Assets, Loans**: User-specific financial data

### Household Sharing (Optional)

Users can be members of households to share expenses and manage joint finances:

- Multiple users can belong to the same household
- Shared expenses can be split between household members
- Different split methods: equal, by percentage, by amount, by room size

## Getting Started

### Test User Account

A test user is automatically created with the following credentials:

- **Email**: test@example.com
- **Password**: Test123!

This account comes with pre-populated test data (50 transactions, budgets, goals, etc.).

### Creating a New Account

1. Navigate to the application
2. Click "Logga in" (Login) in the top navigation bar
3. Click "Registrera dig" (Register) on the login page
4. Fill in your details:
   - First name
   - Last name
   - Email address
   - Password (min 6 characters)
   - Confirm password
5. Click "Registrera" (Register)
6. You'll be automatically logged in and redirected to the dashboard

### Logging In

1. Click "Logga in" (Login) in the navigation bar
2. Enter your email and password
3. Optionally check "Kom ih√•g mig" (Remember me) for persistent sessions
4. Click "Logga in" (Login)

### Logging Out

Click "Logga ut" (Logout) in the navigation bar when logged in.

## Technical Implementation

### Architecture

The authentication system is built using:

- **ASP.NET Core Identity**: Robust authentication framework
- **Entity Framework Core**: User data storage
- **Cookie Authentication**: Secure session management
- **InMemory Database**: Currently uses in-memory storage (can be migrated to SQL Server)

### User Model

```csharp
public class ApplicationUser : IdentityUser
{
    public string? FirstName { get; set; }
    public string? LastName { get; set; }
    public DateTime CreatedAt { get; set; }
    public DateTime? LastLoginAt { get; set; }
    public int? HouseholdMemberId { get; set; }
    public HouseholdMember? HouseholdMember { get; set; }
}
```

### Data Filtering

All services automatically filter data based on the current authenticated user:

- `TransactionService`: Only returns transactions for the current user
- `BudgetService`: Only shows budgets created by the current user
- `GoalService`: Only displays the current user's goals
- `BankSourceService`: Only lists the current user's bank accounts

This is implemented using the `ICurrentUserService` interface, which provides:
- `UserId`: The current authenticated user's ID
- `IsAuthenticated`: Whether a user is currently logged in

### Security Considerations

#### Current Implementation (Development)

- Uses in-memory database (data is lost on restart)
- Simple password requirements for development convenience
- Email confirmation disabled for easier testing
- Account lockout disabled

#### Production Recommendations

For production deployment, consider:

1. **Persistent Database**: Migrate from InMemory to SQL Server or PostgreSQL
2. **Stronger Password Policy**: 
   - Require uppercase, lowercase, digits, and special characters
   - Minimum length of 8-12 characters
3. **Email Confirmation**: Enable email verification for new accounts
4. **Account Lockout**: Enable after multiple failed login attempts
5. **Two-Factor Authentication**: Add 2FA support for enhanced security
6. **HTTPS Only**: Enforce HTTPS in production
7. **Secure Cookie Settings**: Configure secure, HTTP-only cookies
8. **Password Reset**: Implement password reset via email

### Migration to SQL Server

To migrate from InMemory to SQL Server:

1. Add the SQL Server package to Core project:
```bash
dotnet add src/Privatekonomi.Core package Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.SqlServer
```

2. Update `Program.cs` in Web and Api projects:
```csharp
builder.Services.AddDbContext<PrivatekonomyContext>(options =>
    options.UseSqlServer(builder.Configuration.GetConnectionString("DefaultConnection")));
```

3. Add connection string to `appsettings.json`:
```json
{
  "ConnectionStrings": {
    "DefaultConnection": "Server=localhost;Database=Privatekonomi;Trusted_Connection=True;MultipleActiveResultSets=true"
  }
}
```

4. Create initial migration:
```bash
dotnet ef migrations add InitialCreate --project src/Privatekonomi.Core
```

5. Apply migration:
```bash
dotnet ef database update --project src/Privatekonomi.Web
```

## API Authentication

The Web API endpoints now support authentication through the Identity system. API endpoints can be accessed using:

1. **Cookie Authentication**: Automatically used by the Blazor web app
2. **Token Authentication**: Can be added for mobile apps or external clients

To add token-based authentication for the API, consider implementing JWT tokens.

## Future Enhancements

Planned features for the authentication system:

- [ ] Social login (Google, Microsoft, GitHub)
- [ ] Two-factor authentication (2FA)
- [ ] Password reset via email
- [ ] Email confirmation
- [ ] Account lockout after failed attempts
- [ ] User profile management page
- [ ] Admin user roles and permissions
- [ ] Audit logging for security events
- [ ] Session management (view active sessions, logout from all devices)

## Troubleshooting

### Can't log in

- Verify your email and password are correct
- Ensure caps lock is off
- Try registering a new account if you've forgotten your password
- Check browser console for errors

### Data not showing after login

- Data is isolated per user
- If you're a new user, you won't see the test data
- Test data is only associated with test@example.com

### Session expired

- Sessions expire after 30 minutes of inactivity
- Check "Remember me" during login for persistent sessions
- Re-login if your session has expired
