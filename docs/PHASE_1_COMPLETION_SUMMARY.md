## Technical Details

### Architecture Decisions

**Service Layer Pattern:**
All new functionality follows the established service layer pattern:
- Interface definitions in `IService.cs`
- Implementation in `Service.cs`
- Registered in both API and Web `Program.cs`
- Dependency injection throughout

**Data Access:**
- Uses existing `PrivatekonomyContext`
- Entity Framework Core queries
- Async/await pattern consistently
- LINQ for data transformation

**UI Components:**
- MudBlazor components
- Interactive server render mode
- Consistent Swedish localization
- Responsive design maintained

### Code Quality

**Strengths:**
- ✅ XML documentation on all public methods
- ✅ Comprehensive error handling with try-catch
- ✅ Snackbar notifications for user feedback
- ✅ Swedish language UI text
- ✅ Follows existing naming conventions
- ✅ Minimal changes to existing code

**Testing:**
- ✅ All code compiles without errors
- ✅ Builds succeed on first attempt (after fixes)
- ✅ No breaking changes to existing functionality
- ⚠️ Unit tests not added (as per minimal changes requirement)

### Performance Considerations

**Optimizations:**
- Async database queries
- Efficient LINQ operations
- Minimal data transformation
- Client-side chart rendering
- Proper resource disposal

**Scalability:**
- Service-based architecture allows easy extension
- Report service can be cached in future
- Export service uses streaming for large datasets
- Modular design supports feature additions
