# Transaction Flow Improvements - Implementation Summary

## Completed Work

This pull request successfully implements the improvements requested in the issue "Redigera transaktioner och ändra kategori" (Edit transactions and change category).

## What Was Implemented

### 1. ✅ Edit Transaction Dialog with Category Selection
- Added a visual category selector in the edit transaction dialog
- Users can now change or assign categories when editing transactions
- Category picker shows color-coded indicators for easy identification
- Ability to remove category assignment
- Clean, intuitive interface following Material Design principles

**Technical Implementation:**
- Integrated `ICategoryService` to load available categories
- Added category selection state management
- Updates transaction categories atomically on save
- Preserves existing functionality while adding new features

### 2. ✅ Enhanced Transaction List View
- Improved visual clarity with better color coding
- Income shown in green (+prefix), expenses in red (no prefix)
- Uncategorized transactions now clearly marked with "Okategoriserad" chip
- Better number formatting (e.g., "+4,467.56 kr" instead of "-4 467,56 kr")
- Added tooltips to action buttons for better UX
- Cleaner bank source display

**Visual Improvements:**
- Consistent use of filled variants for category/bank chips
- Better spacing and margins for multiple categories
- Color-coded amounts (#2e7d32 for income, #d32f2f for expenses)
- Professional typography with appropriate font weights

### 3. ✅ Export Functionality (CSV & JSON)
Both export functions were already implemented but have been enhanced with:
- User filtering for security (users only export their own data)
- Consistent behavior with other services in the application

**Export Features:**
- **CSV Export**: Includes all transaction fields in a readable format
- **JSON Export**: Includes nested category information with full details
- Automatic file download with timestamp in filename
- Success/error feedback via snackbar notifications

## Files Modified

1. **EditTransactionDialog.razor** - Enhanced with category selection capability
2. **Transactions.razor** - Improved visual display and formatting
3. **ExportService.cs** - Added user filtering for data security

## Quality Assurance

- 0 errors, 9 pre-existing warnings (unrelated to changes)
- No new warnings introduced

### Security Analysis: ✅ CLEAN
