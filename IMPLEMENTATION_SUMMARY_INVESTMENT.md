## Database Changes

### New DbSets Added to PrivatekonomyContext
- `DbSet<Pension> Pensions`
- `DbSet<Dividend> Dividends`
- `DbSet<InvestmentTransaction> InvestmentTransactions`
- `DbSet<PortfolioAllocation> PortfolioAllocations`

### Entity Framework Configurations
- Full EF Core model configurations for all new entities
- Proper indexes for performance
- Decimal precision settings (18,2 for amounts, 18,4 for shares)
- Foreign key relationships with cascade delete where appropriate
- User ownership tracking on all entities

## Service Registration
All new services registered in `Program.cs`:
- `IPensionService` → `PensionService`
- `IDividendService` → `DividendService`

## Documentation

### New Documentation Files
- **docs/INVESTMENT_PENSION_GUIDE.md** - Comprehensive user guide covering:
  - Pension management features
  - Investment types and aggregation
  - Dividend tracking (foundation)
  - Investment transactions (foundation)
  - Portfolio allocation (foundation)
  - Tips and best practices
  - Future features roadmap
  - MinPension.se integration recommendation

## Architecture Decisions

### 1. User-Based Data Isolation
All models include `UserId` field and all services filter by current user, ensuring:
- Multi-user support
- Data privacy and security
- Proper authorization

### 2. Extensible Design
Models are designed to be extended:
- Optional fields for flexibility (e.g., `MonthlyContribution`, `RetirementAge`)
- Notes fields for user annotations
- Temporal tracking ready (ValidFrom/ValidTo not yet implemented on new models but can be added)

### 3. Swedish Market Focus
- Account types specific to Swedish market (ISK, KF, AF)
- Swedish pension types (Tjänstepension, Allmän pension)
- Currency defaults to SEK
- Integration recommendations for Swedish services (minpension.se)

## Testing Impact
- All existing tests still pass (66/67, same as before changes)
- One pre-existing failing test unrelated to these changes
- New models and services ready for unit testing

## Migration Path

### For Existing Installations
When deploying this update:
1. Database will auto-migrate (EnsureCreated)
2. New tables will be created automatically
3. Existing data remains untouched
4. Users can start using pension tracking immediately

### For New Installations
- All tables created on first run
- Test data seeding works as before
- New features available from the start

## Future Implementation Recommendations

### Phase 4: Advanced Returns (Not Yet Implemented)
- XIRR calculation service
- TWR calculation service
- Benchmark comparison against OMXS30, S&P500, etc.
- Fee tracking and impact analysis

### Phase 5: Allocation & Rebalancing (Partially Implemented)
- UI for portfolio allocation settings
- Visualization of current vs target allocation
- Rebalancing recommendations
- Risk analysis and factor exposure

### Phase 6: Tax Lot Management (Partially Implemented)
- UI for investment transactions
- FIFO/LIFO cost basis calculation
- K4 tax report generation
- Tax year views

### Phase 7: Dividend Tracking UI (Partially Implemented)
- Dividend history page
- Dividend calendar
- Yield calculations
- DRIP automation

## Security Considerations
- All endpoints filter by authenticated user
- No cross-user data access possible
- Sensitive financial data protected by user authentication
- Ready for encryption of sensitive fields if needed

## Performance Considerations
- Efficient aggregation queries using GroupBy
- Indexes on foreign keys and commonly queried fields
- Decimal precision optimized for financial calculations
- Lazy loading avoided through proper Include() statements

## Breaking Changes
None. This is purely additive functionality.

## Recommendation for Deployment
1. Review and test in development environment
2. Run database migrations in staging
3. Deploy to production
4. Communicate new features to users
5. Provide user guide (INVESTMENT_PENSION_GUIDE.md)

## Success Metrics
- Users can track pensions from multiple providers
- Users can aggregate investments by account type
- Foundation laid for advanced features (dividends, XIRR, TWR)
- Extensible architecture for future enhancements
